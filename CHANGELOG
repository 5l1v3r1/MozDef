## [v1.37] - 2019-03-01
### Added
- Watchlist - use the UI to quickly add a term (username, IP, command, etc.) that MozDef alerts on
- Generic Deadman - use a simple config file to validate that expected events are appearing in a given time window (and alert an Error when they do not)

### Changed
- Improve error handling on Slack bot
- Improve Slack bot alert format for better readibility
- Minor UI adjustments

### Fixed
- Some Duo events were not correctly displaying the source IP address. It is now always the access device IP
- Fixed defaults for Slack bot to ensure more consistency each time it loads
- Added checks on sending SQS messages to only accept intra-account messages
- Improved docker performance and disk space requirements
